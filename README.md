# FÃ¡bio's Personal Website

My (pretty simple) personal website. This project started when I was approached by a recruiter to apply for a front-end position, back in 2021. I wanted to practice and remember how to even do web devolopment since, at the time, I had not touched any of it for almost a year. 

I did not get the position, but since I do not do anything half-way, the project continued, and I released it in 2021.

In 2022, I did a full rehaul of the website, refactoring most of the CSS code according to the BEM notation, applying OOP CSS concepts and changing the website to a Mobile First Approach. I also took optimization more into consideration through the use of Google Lighthouse tool.

The website is built using HTML5, traditional CSS3, the Bootstrap 5 framework, some jQuery and the [AOS](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) Lib. Currently, it is deployed on [Netlify](https://endearing-tulumba-e77ef5.netlify.app/) and built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
